                <h2>How did you know about him?</h2>
                <p>It been a couple a years since I have listened to the Kase.O's music,
                it was one of my friends who played one track that automatically envolved my mind.
                Since the very beggining I got really identified with the lyrics, the bass and the rythm.
                I still remember the 1st song I listened was <i><b>Vivir para contarlo</i></b>, since then
                I consider myself a really big fan of this man's art.
